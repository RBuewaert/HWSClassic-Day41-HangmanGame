"This is the first challenge that involves you creating a game. You’ll still be using UIKit, though, so it’s a good chance to practice your app skills too.

The challenge is this: make a hangman game using UIKit.
As a reminder, this means choosing a random word from a list of possibilities, but presenting it to the user as a series of underscores.
So, if your word was “RHYTHM” the user would see “??????”.

The user can then guess letters one at a time: if they guess a letter that it’s in the word, e.g. H, it gets revealed to make “?H??H?”;
if they guess an incorrect letter, they inch closer to death. If they seven incorrect answers they lose,
but if they manage to spell the full word before that they win."
